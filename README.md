This C++ program presents an engaging implementation of a classic Number Guessing Game,
where participants strive to deduce a randomly generated number falling within a designated range.
Offering players a selection among Easy, Intermediate, Advanced, or Custom difficulty tiers,
the game grants a finite series of attempts to pinpoint the elusive number. 
Providing insightful prompts advising whether to aim higher or lower with each conjecture, it facilitates an immersive and interactive experience. 
Should the player exhaust their chances without hitting the mark, the game gracefully concludes, 
affording the option to either embark on another round or gracefully exit.
